<p>The data we'll be using comes from the <a href="https://zindi.africa/competitions/sendy-logistics-challenge">Sendy Logistics Challenge on Zindi</a>. You'll need to register on Zindi to join the competition and access the data, which comes as 5 separate files:</p>
<ul>
<li>Train.csv - is the dataset that you will use to train your model.</li>
<li>Test.csv - is the dataset on which you will apply your model to.</li>
<li>Riders.csv - contains unique rider Ids, number of orders, age, rating and number of ratings</li>
<li>VariableDefinitions.csv - Definitions of variables in the Train, Test and Riders files</li>
<li>SampleSubmission.csv - Shows the submission format (we'll look at this later, in lesson 4)</li>
</ul>
