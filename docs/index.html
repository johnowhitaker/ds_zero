<p>I'm working with some cool people at the moment, and we've decided to try and learn some Data Science together. This project is going to end up being some combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A short 'course' with some learning material and lots of exercises</li>
<li>A collection of links to other great resources</li>
<li>One or more 'suggested learning paths' - routes we find helpful for others wanting to learn and not sure where to start.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're all pretty busy, so I'm going to try and keep things as minimal as possible.</p>
<p>This whole thing is built with NBDev. It should be up on <a href="https://johnowhitaker.github.io/ds_zero/">https://johnowhitaker.github.io/ds_zero/</a>, all built in Jupyter Notebooks.</p>
