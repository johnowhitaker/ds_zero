    "At the end of lesson 1 we saw a machine learning model being created, trained and used to make predictions... in three lines of code. We don't understand that code yet, but it hints at a secret: the machine learning bit is often the easy part. So for this lesson, we look more closely at the steps that come before the modelling: data cleaning and exploration.\n",

    "### Lesson 3 - Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "With some basics covered, let's revisit the machine learning example from lesson one and build on that, exploring some of the different kinds of tasks you may encounter, playing with different methods and learning how to choose the best tool for the job.\n",

    "Putting the lessons into practice, and learning some extra tips to make our models better.\n",

    "### Lesson 5 - Deep Learning: Image Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Image Classification is one of the most popular applications of deep learning. This lesson shows how easy it can be, and gives a starting point for going deeper into this topic.\n",
